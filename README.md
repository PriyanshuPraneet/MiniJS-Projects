# MiniJS-Projects
These are basic and common JavaScript projects which helped me grasp the fundamentals of development. Through these mini JavaScript projects, I've developed a strong foundation in core web development concepts. Each project helped me understand different aspects of JavaScript programming - from DOM manipulation and event handling to timing functions and state management. Working on these projects has given me hands-on experience with real-world programming challenges and improved my problem-solving abilities. The projects demonstrate my progression in mastering JavaScript fundamentals while creating practical, interactive web applications.
